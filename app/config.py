app/config.py

Centralized configuration, driven by environment variables (loaded from
.env via python-dotenv). This replaces the old pattern of flipping
USE_SAMPLE_DATA / USE_REALISTIC_DATA / USE_GENERATED_DATA booleans directly
in fetch_listings.py — in a real project you don't want to edit source code
to change which data source or AI provider is active, especially once this
runs anywhere besides your laptop (staging, CI, a teammate's machine).

Set these in your .env file:
    DATA_SOURCE=generated        # one of: live, sample, realistic, generated
    AI_PROVIDER=anthropic        # one of: anthropic, openai
    SCORE_THRESHOLD=60           # 0-100
    BATCH_SIZE=8
    CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=*         # comma-separated in production, e.g. https://yourapp.com
